# Computer Organization and Architecture

Lab work for Computer Organization and Architecture including the design and implementation of a RISC processor, using ALTERA FPGA development system, Quartus-II. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

The main topics include basic architecture of modern computers, interaction between computer hardware and software at various levels, and performance evaluation and metrics. Instruction set design, computer arithmetic is also discussed. Data path and control unit design for RISC Processors are covered in detail. The laboratory work includes the design and implementation of a 16-bit RISC CPU using an FPGA development system and VHDL.
